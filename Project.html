                    <h1>PASHUPATI HOTEL</h1>
                    <p>This website prototype was made by me for Pashupati Hotel, which currently doesnâ€™t have its own website. The hotel is located in Kathmandu, Nepal, and mainly uses Facebook and third-party platforms for bookings. I first created a hand-sketched wireframe, then recreated it digitally using Figma. The technologies I used to build this website include Figma, HTML, CSS, and Java.</p>

                    <h1>COIN COLLECTION GAME</h1>
                    <p>This is a wireframe for one of the labs I worked on. Due to ethical concerns and confidentiality, I can't share the full project since the lab is still ongoing. In this part, I designed a wireframe for a coin collection game inside a virtual reality simulation to help older adults prepare for natural disasters. The idea was later developed into a game within the simulation so users could get familiar with both the device and the environment.</p>
