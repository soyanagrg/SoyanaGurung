                    <h1>PASHUPATI HOTEL</h1>
                    <p>This website prototype was made by me for Pashupati Hotel, which currently doesn’t have its own website. The hotel is located in Kathmandu, Nepal, and mainly uses Facebook and third-party platforms for bookings. I first created a hand-sketched wireframe, then recreated it digitally using Figma. The technologies I used to build this website include Figma, HTML, CSS, and Java.</p>

                    <h1>COIN COLLECTION GAME</h1>
                    <p>This is a wireframe for one of the labs I worked on. Due to ethical concerns and confidentiality, I can't share the full project since the lab is still ongoing. In this part, I designed a wireframe for a coin collection game inside a virtual reality simulation to help older adults prepare for natural disasters. The idea was later developed into a game within the simulation so users could get familiar with both the device and the environment.</p>

                    <h1>Soyafy (Spotify Front-end Practice)</h1>
                    <p>This is a website where I’ve tried to mimic the popular music web application Spotify. The project is still under construction. So far, I’ve used various tools and technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma, VS Code, and GitHub. I designed and developed a Spotify-inspired web interface, used Figma to wireframe and draft the layout, and I’m currently working on building multiple pages while refining the front-end structure. I plan to add responsiveness for mobile and tablet compatibility and will implement back-end functionality once the front-end is complete. <br>
