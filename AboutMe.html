                <p>Hello again! My name is Soyana Gurung, and I recently graduated from the University at Albany with a B.S. degree in <strong>Informatics</strong>, with a concentration in <i>Software Development</i>. I am originally from Nepal and came to the United States around three years ago to pursue my education. During my time at the University, I gained valuable knowledge and skills in many areas. I’ve listed my technical skills below.</p>
                <p><strong>TECHNICAL SKILLS</strong><br>
                <strong>Object Oriented Programming: </strong>Python, Java, JavaScript <br>
                <strong>Web Content Management: </strong>HTML, CSS<br> 
                <strong>Database:</strong> SQL (SQLite) <br>
                <strong>Tools and Technologies: </strong>Figma, Convai, Meta, Blender, Unity<br>
                <strong>Foreign Language: </strong>Fluent in Nepali and Hindi
                </p>
                <p>Outside of work and study, I enjoy exploring new music and art. I am currently seeking a software development role, front-end or back-end, I’m open to both! I have experience in front-end projects like web creation, UI/UX design, wireframing, and more. I’ve also taken relevant courses such as Advanced Concepts in Practical Software Development, Data Structures, Programming for Informatics, Introduction to Web Technologies, and Intermediate Interactive Design.</p>
